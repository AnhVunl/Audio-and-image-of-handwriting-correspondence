# Predict audio file and handwriting image correspondence

The goal is to predict whether an image and an audio file mentions the same digit. We implemented a neural network and achieved an accuracy of 98.2 on the hold-out test set. 

The notebook summarizes the steps below:

1. Feature engineering
2. Set up and implement a five-layered neural network
3. Tune hyperparameters
3. Evaluate
